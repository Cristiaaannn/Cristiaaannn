Embarking on a journey in software engineering, I am passionately diving into the depths of C++ and its applications in modern software development. Balancing my professional role as a software engineer in Linux/OS development at Luxoft, I am concurrently focusing on expanding my expertise in GUI development and algorithmic challenges.
My goal is to master the intricacies of C++ and contribute to innovative software solutions while gaining valuable work experience in a dynamic industry environment.

**ðŸš€ Current Focus:**

Languages: Deepening my expertise in C++, with a special emphasis on GUI development using libraries like Qt.

C++ and Algorithm Mastery: Engaged in studying "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup and exploring "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth, alongside my professional work in Linux/OS development.


**ðŸ’¡ Current Projects:**

-  **C++ Learning Journey:**
Managing a repository dedicated to solutions and exercises from "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. This reflects my progress and understanding of C++ in tandem with my professional work. [[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Cristiaaannn/PPPUCPP)]


-  **TAOCP Visualizer Project:**
A future project set to begin following the completion of the C++ Learning Journey. This ambitious initiative aims to create a C++ GUI visualizer for the concepts and exercises in Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming". The project is intended to showcase my commitment to understanding and visualizing complex algorithms and data structures, integrating my practical experiences from work.
