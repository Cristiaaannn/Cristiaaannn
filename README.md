Embarking on a journey in software engineering, I am passionately diving into the depths of C++ and its applications in modern software development. Balancing my professional role as a software engineer in Linux/OS development at Luxoft, I am concurrently focusing on expanding my expertise in GUI development and algorithmic challenges.
My goal is to master the intricacies of C++ and contribute to innovative software solutions while gaining valuable work experience in a dynamic industry environment.

**ðŸš€ Current Focus:**

Languages: Deepening my expertise in C++, with a special emphasis on GUI development using libraries like Qt.

C++ and Algorithm Mastery: Engaged in studying "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup and exploring "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth, alongside my professional work in Linux/OS development.


**ðŸ’¡ Current Projects:**

-  **C++ Learning Journey:**
Managing a repository dedicated to solutions and exercises from "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. This reflects my progress and understanding of C++ in tandem with my professional work. [[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Cristiaaannn/PPPUCPP)]


-  **TAOCP Visualizer Project:**
A forthcoming project set to commence after the C++ Learning Journey. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive C++ GUI visualizer for algorithms and data structures, inspired by the teachings in "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) and MIT's algorithm lectures. The goal is to create an interactive and engaging tool to visualize and understand complex algorithmic concepts. [Link to Repository - Coming Soon]


**ðŸŒŸ Professional Statement:**

As I navigate the early stages of my career at Luxoft, I am focused on building a strong foundation in C++ and GUI development. My passion lies in unraveling the complexities of programming and using my skills to develop innovative and impactful software. Dedicated to continuous learning, I am eager to apply my expanding knowledge in a dynamic and creative environment, leveraging my practical experiences in Linux/OS development.
