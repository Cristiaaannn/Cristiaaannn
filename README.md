About me : 
I live in a world of infinite possibilities, preferring to see things not as they are but as they could be. 
I know that life is limited only by the boundaries of your own beliefs, and I'm driven to push the limits of, well, everything.
Emotional, passion-driven, and full of ideas, I combine a vivid imagination with a desire for practical solutions. 
My introspective and intuitive nature is balanced by a keen interest in the world around me and a desire to contribute to society. 
Charismatic and expressive, I love sharing my ideas and visions with others and creating community around shared values and ideals. 
My greatest gift? The ability to see the spark of potential in everything and everyone, and to inspire others to see it, too. I am able to guide people toward an invisible horizon with a rare generosity of spirit and strength of conviction.
