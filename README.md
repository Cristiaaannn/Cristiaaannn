Embarking on a journey in software engineering, I am passionately diving into the depths of C++ and its applications in modern software development. Balancing my professional role as a software engineer in Linux/OS development at Luxoft, I am concurrently focusing on expanding my expertise in GUI development and algorithmic challenges.
My goal is to master the intricacies of C++ and contribute to innovative software solutions while gaining valuable work experience in a dynamic industry environment.

**ðŸš€ Current Focus:**

Languages: Deepening my expertise in C++, with a special emphasis on GUI development.

C++ and Algorithm Mastery: Engaged in studying "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup and exploring "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth, alongside my professional work in Linux/OS development.


**ðŸ’¡ Current Projects:**

-  **C++ Learning Journey:**
Managing a repository dedicated to solutions and exercises from "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. This reflects my progress and understanding of C++ in tandem with my professional work. [[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Cristiaaannn/PPPUCPP)]


-  **General DSA and Algorithm Visualizer Project**: 
  A forthcoming project set to begin following the completion of my C++ Learning Journey. This ambitious initiative aims to create a comprehensive C++ GUI visualizer for data structures and algorithms. The goal is to develop an interactive and engaging tool that brings complex algorithmic concepts and data structures to life, making them more accessible and understandable.
